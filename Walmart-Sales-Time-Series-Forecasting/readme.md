# Walmart Sales Time Series Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **forecasting Walmart sales** using time-series analysis and machine learning techniques. The dataset includes historical sales data, and the goal is to develop predictive models that can help optimize inventory and business decision-making.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and data cleaning.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding patterns, trends, and seasonality in sales data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features for improved forecasting.
- **Time-Series Forecasting Models:**
  - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - Exponential Smoothing (ETS)
  - Machine Learning Models (XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTMs)
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparing performance metrics (RMSE, MAPE, etc.).
- **Predictions & Visualization:** Graphical representation of forecasted sales trends.
