# Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL)

This folder contains practical implementations of **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** algorithms as part of hands-on learning. These notebooks explore fundamental DRL concepts, including **DQN, DDPG, and TD3**, applied to solving complex decision-making tasks.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
1. **`03_1_dqn_introduction_studentm.ipynb`**  
   - Introduction to **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**  
   - Covers Q-learning and policy optimization  
   - Uses environments from **OpenAI Gym**

2. **`03_2_dqn_full_studentm.ipynb`**  
   - Advanced DQN implementation  
   - Experience replay and target networks  
   - Hyperparameter tuning and performance improvements  

3. **`04_ddpg_td3_studentm.ipynb`**  
   - **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**  
   - **Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)** for continuous action spaces  
   - Exploration strategies and policy evaluation
